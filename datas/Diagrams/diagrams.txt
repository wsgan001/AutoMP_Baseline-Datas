SYS DBpedia (complex)

3.diagrams:
NDCG@10 (all the baseline and AutoMP) on simple queries(POP and DBPE)
NDCG@20 (all the baseline and AutoMP) on simple queries(POP and DBPE)
NDCG@10 (all the baseline and AutoMP) on complex queries(SYS)
NDCG@20 (all the baseline and AutoMP) on complex queries(SYS)

?? Running time of AutoMP as Number of meta-paths increse with various number of example entitiies

NDCG@10 (AutoMP only) on simple queries(POP and DBPE) with increasing Number of example entities
NDCG@20 (AutoMP only) on simple queries(POP and DBPE) with increasing Number of example entities
NDCG@10 (AutoMP only) on complex queries(SYS) with increasing Number of example entities
NDCG@20 (AutoMP only) on complex queries(SYS) with increasing Number of example entities

NDCG@10 (AutoMP only) on simple queries(POP and DBPE) with increasing Number of meta-paths
NDCG@20 (AutoMP only) on simple queries(POP and DBPE) with increasing Number of meta-paths
NDCG@10 (AutoMP only) on complex queries(SYS) with increasing Number of meta-paths
NDCG@20 (AutoMP only) on complex queries(SYS) with increasing Number of meta-paths

4.case study:

select on of the query from SYS to illustrate the effectiveness of AutoMP
